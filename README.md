# Chess UI

## Project Overview

This project is a simple, static user interface for a chessboard built using HTML and CSS Grid. The chessboard layout is created with CSS Grid to represent an 8x8 grid with alternating dark and light squares. This project focuses on the visual aspect of a chess game, without game logic or interactivity.

## Features

- A responsive chessboard built entirely with HTML and CSS Grid.
- Alternating light and dark squares representing a traditional chessboard.
- Clean and minimal design, making it easy to adapt for future development (e.g., adding JavaScript for game logic).
- Fully responsive layout that adjusts for different screen sizes.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the chessboard structure.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file for styling the chessboard using the CSS Grid layout.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: 
  The chessboard is constructed using an 8x8 grid, where each square (either light or dark) is represented by a `div` element. 
- **CSS Grid**: 
  CSS Grid is used to arrange these `div` elements into a perfect grid that forms the chessboard. The squares are styled with different background colors to create the alternating pattern of a chessboard.
